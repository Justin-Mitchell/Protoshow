Protoshow is a free and easy to use slideshow for use with the Prototype.js and script.aculo.us javascript libraries.

The script has recently (July 2011) moved into Beta release and is generally suitable for production use (indeed I'm using in several client projects). The script is under active development. Follow @get_dave on Twitter for updates.
